# SpotifyGroupMusic-HackWSU
 
This is a hackathon project I did with a friend while in college in 2016.

The general idea is that you and all your friends would authenticate to Spotify, the application would analyze everyone's playlists, then generate a new playlist with a list of songs that should appeal to almost everyone.

Spotify has/had some cool endpoints that gave different statistics about songs, such as dancability, instrument to voice ratio, and others.

I can't speak to the overall quality of the code.  We were coding for 24 hours straight and rushing to get anything done.  We managed to finish everything we planned out, and took 4th place in the end, which we were pretty happy with.
